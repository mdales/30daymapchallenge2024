# 30daymapschallenge: Day 5 - Journey

A quick map today. Using this python script I just extracted the lat/lng of most of my photos from my Lightroom catalogue and plotted the as H3 tiles using [keplar.gl](https://keplar.gl). This tells you I've not travelled far and wide mostly. There must be some Lightroom data I'm missing, as I know I have tagged photos in places that didn't get extracted, but day 4 took too much time, so day 5 has to be super quick!
